                Howdy! My name is John Nichols, I am from Kingwood, Texas and I am currently a Junior Computer Science major with a Business Minor at <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. 
                I am involved with several on campus clubs, including the <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club (ACC)</a> and the <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.c-e-o.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiAo4OQBhBBEiwA5KWu_6R0uBBfOHXed277gAwuWmhTgog_fBXMVLHNDccfLR5AJMqAGfy-gBoCl5YQAvD_BwE">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization (CEO)</a>.
                The Aggie Coding Club allows me to take what I have learned in class and exemplify that information creatively by making projects that would not
                typically be done in a classroom setting. The work I do with Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization is very similar, where I take ideas and turn
                them into productive projects that are displayed at competitions.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also done some relevant work outside of school as well. I have worked various part time jobs from a Front-End Associate at <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com/">Chick-fil-A</a> to
                a dough chef at Papa Johnâ€™s. My current job, for the last two years, has been a DoorDash driver where I promptly assist customers by delivering
                food from various locations right to their door.  I have also done some front-end development work for a freelance company named <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a>.
                There, I partnered up with another computer science student from the University of Houston and created a professional profile on Upwork that
                accepted work in modifying and designing websites. Together over the summer of 2021, we worked on 4 extensive projects for 4 different companies.
                However, most of these projects were done with a team of freelancers that the respective company hired so we were able to gain valuable experience
                working with a professional team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy taking part in pickup basketball, playing video games, and coding. Despite building this website for a class,
                I had a ton of fun designing and constructing it and look forward to developing more projects similar to this in the future. 
                If you would like to know more about me, feel free to shoot me an email or connect with me on <a class="external" target="_blank"
