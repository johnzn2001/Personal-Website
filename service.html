            <p>
                Since freshman year I have been involved in an organization called the <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/tamc">12th Can On Campus Food Pantry</a>. 
                Two to three times a week I go into a food pantry located on Texas A&M University and serve food to both 
                students and residents of College Station who are in need. My involvement in this organization has been one of 
                the most rewarding experiences in my time here at Texas A&M.

            <p>
                Since high school I have worked alongside an organization called the <a class="external" target="_blank"
                href="https://kingwoodumc.org/community-support/">Society of St. Stephen</a> at the Kingwood United Methodist Church.
                This organization’s primary goal is to help those in need in whatever way possible, whether that be through providing food
                and clothing or providing manual help with tasks around an individual’s home. When I am home in Kingwood, Texas I tend to spend
                5 to 10 hours a week involved in this organization helping with the various activities needed.
